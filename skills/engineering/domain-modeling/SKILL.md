# Domain modeling

Build and sharpen the project's domain model as you design: challenge terms, invent edge-case scenarios, and write terms and decisions down the moment they settle. This skill is for changing the model. Reading `GLOSSARY.md` for vocabulary is a one-line habit any skill has.

## File structure

Most repos have a single context:

```
/
├── GLOSSARY.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│       └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

If a `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` exists at the root, the repo has multiple contexts. The map points to where each one lives:

```
/
├── GLOSSARY-MAP.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
├── src/
│   ├── ordering/
│   │   ├── GLOSSARY.md
│   │   └── docs/adr/                 ← context-specific decisions
│   └── billing/
│       ├── GLOSSARY.md
│       └── docs/adr/
```

Create files lazily: only when you have something to write. If no `GLOSSARY.md` exists, create one when the first term is resolved. If no `docs/adr/` exists, create it when the first ADR is needed.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `GLOSSARY.md`, call it out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y. Which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'account': do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When the conversation turns to domain relationships, stress-test them with specific scenarios. Invent ones that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. If you find a contradiction, point it out: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible. Which is right?"

### Update GLOSSARY.md inline

When a term is resolved, write it to `GLOSSARY.md` at once, one term at a time as each is settled. Use the format in [GLOSSARY-FORMAT.md](./GLOSSARY-FORMAT.md).

`GLOSSARY.md` holds term definitions and nothing else: no implementation details, spec, scratch notes or implementation decisions.

### Offer ADRs sparingly

Only offer to create an ADR when all three are true:

1. **Hard to reverse**: the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context**: a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off**: there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If any of the three is missing, skip the ADR. Use the format in [ADR-FORMAT.md](./ADR-FORMAT.md).
